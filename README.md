My research investigates the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on high school students’ ability to progress mathematically in preparation for college math classes. It explores students’ opinions on how the pandemic affected their math learning and analyzes how their actual group math performance at Indiana University of Pennsylvania compares with their collective opinions. Part of my research consists of an online Qualtrics survey that was sent to all Intermediate Algebra Spring 2022 and Fall 2022 students, which is complemented by institutionally provided identity-wiped data through the IUP Department of Mathematical and Computer Sciences. We compare the two cohorts and determine if there was a difference in mathematical knowledge between the two cohorts, and if that difference could be primarily attributed to whether the pandemic lockdown occurred during the sophomore or junior high school year for the students. As seen at IUP, students who have a lower placement in their mathematics course sequence are more likely to switch out of a natural science major and are more likely to not finish their college degree. Studying the negative effects of the pandemic on math knowledge can help to lead to an understanding of how much more remediation might be needed for these students.
